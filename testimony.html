                    <li>I am Lyza Mae Castro and I am writing this testimony to provide evidence of my learning, and so with extending my heartfelt gratitude to the people behind the implementation of the training entitled "Empowering Community ALS Implementers". It is one of the foundation of strong and new knowlege on Information and communications technology (ICT). Indeed, the knowledge gained are useful not only to me, but also to my future Alternative Learning System (ALS) learners. All the topics shared during the sessions in the training are present in the learning strand. Thus, the assurance of providing quality education to my learners is possible. Before joining the training, I already had knowledge on microsoft powerpoint and microsoft excel yet it is not that much. And through the help of the training, my knowledge was sharpened and I got something new and benefecial. 
                </p> On the first session, it was all about knowing the hardware, software, front and back panel of a system unit. It was discussed thoroughly and the function of each was emphasized. Secondly, shortcut keys were shared by the lecturer, including some function of a spreadsheet in the aspect of calculation through using formulas. Thirdly, we, the CAIs explored more the micosoft powerpoint. We were able to grasp more techniques on making the powerpoint presentation more creative and lively with the usage of transition, animation and inserting of images, videos, music etc. Indeed, this can be applied in enhancing the instructional materials I can take advantage with during the teaching-learning process. Lastly, we experienced creating our own webpage. It is challenging but manageable on the other hand as assistance is well provided with the lecturer and the staff. </li>
